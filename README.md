# The Raw
It is the demo version of the game. I named it "The Raw" because the main idea is about the raw (green) boy, who had lost his family and got a soul raw (interpret it as a pain). He wants to avenge the rats. Rats are robbers, they are the reason for the loss of the boy.

This game developed for that ![Gamedev.js gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2022). 

There are a bunch of screenshots:
