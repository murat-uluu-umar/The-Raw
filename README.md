# The Raw
It is the demo. I named it "The Raw", because the main idea is about the raw (green) boy, who had lost his family and got a soul raw (interpret it as a pain). He wants to avenge the rats. Rats are robbers, they are the reason for the loss of the boy.

This game developed for that ![Gamedev.js gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2022) as a html game. 
The theme was: RAW. My project was judged based on how well I implement the theme, and I could interpret it however I like.
Games was voted on based on a given criteria: Innovation, Theme, Gameplay, Graphics, and Audio. The Overall ranking was based on the summary of those.

So don't be hesitate! Try out this game on ![itch.io](https://murat-uulu-umar.itch.io/the-raw-genezis)
